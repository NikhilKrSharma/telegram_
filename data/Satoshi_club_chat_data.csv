**Gaming Market Potentials:** 
The size of the entire gaming market is approximately 200 billion dollars, with about half of that in the mobile gaming sector. Following the Datamagic Report in 2021, Mobile and PC revenues are projected to account for 72.8% of the Global game market. 

**Demole's solution: 
**Demole is the perfect bridge between these 2 markets, a game for not only investors who want to earn but also for gamers who are looking for the fantasy game with the breathtaking game plot and 3D graphics. We will bring out the very first 3D NFT Defi monster Legends in the market in Q4, 2021. 

🔥Stay tuned for IDO and game release!

1203273,
1203272,
1203271,"Estimated range for each category:

Frequent burn: 30-70%
The more the token burnt, the more valuable the token is. This mechanic is for investors.

Product development & system maintenance: 5-25%

In-game rewards: 10-35%
This portion, when combined with promotional programs like referral programs, ensures that early players will have an incentive to invite friends.

Staking reward pool: 5-20%
This is to encourage both investors (LP farmers) and gamers (join training grounds to level up monsters and receive tokens)."
1203270,Nice system 👍
1203269,"For example, when the token inflation rate is high; a higher percentage of used tokens will be burnt; when the referral program is launched for gamers, the in-game rewards will get more from the total in-game spending."
1203268,The exact percentage for each category will be defined in different stages.
1203267,"So, this is how it goes"
1203266,Our beautiful chart
1203265,"Yes, right!"
1203263,"Second of all, this is how we distribute our tokens"
1203262,It is a headache isnt it?
1203261,"Ok, first of all, no taxes"

1203255,"Q6 from Telegram user @victorogb
Demole has dutifuly incorporated a token redistribution feature within it’s ecosystem, and a bulk of this redistributed tokens are from in-game spending. As noble as this is, can you clearly provide us with a detailed breakdown of how these tokens are distributed accordingly within your platform, what percentage of this is given back to users, and will this action be an automated and continuous process? Finally, can you talk on Demole’s tax regimes and token burn operations, what specific activities would incur fees, what percentage are charged on such actions, and how often will you carry out your token burn operation?"
1203254,This is the great community where you can chat with folks
1203253,Yes not only me but everyone in my team

1203223,"- This is for gamers, so there will be a lot of rewarding coming up"
1203222,btw we in the middle of our AMA and i think we still don't know what blockchain  do you use for your game 😁 do users have to worry about any problems with gas?😉
1203221,which I think will ensure in-game justice which you would like to ask
1203220,Demole focused on the game parts where we would love gamers to stragically form their teams and come up with tactics
1203219,Which players will be the key moderator
1203218,- What we aim for Demole is to make Gamefi to become Defi
1203217,Will users from any country be available to play? Or you will have some restrictions?
1203216,"- Yes, PvE and PvP as explained will allow you to be with team and be alone"
1203215,"Ok again, will break into part"
1203214,"Q5 from Telegram user @Tahsinahmett
What do I need to do to make a strong and superior start to the demole game? Are there conditions and limitations for playing the demole game? How does Demole plan to provide in-game justice? Do you have a reward or referral program where we can be rewarded when we invite our friends to the Demole game? Do we have the opportunity to play your game with our friends as a team or by forming a team?"
1203213,Absolutely yes
1203212,"Rae, thank you for your answers! Ready to jump to the next question?🔥"
1203211,

News: T.me/Demoleio"
1203196,"I mean, where would be better than here to know about that"
1203195,"will you have your own marketplace, where user be able to sell and buy monsters? or you will join to any other already existed NFT marketplaces?"
1203194,Any time or there will be some timeframes (lockups)?
1203193,So I would say to keep the best for the last
1203192,"For many other features, I think if I leaked out now this dose of curiousity will not be the same"
1203191,Absolutely
1203190,And Monster Nest is where you will receive your monsters easily
1203189,"Can they receive them back? Unstake, let's say"
1203188,nice feature 👍
1203187,"Yes, Training Ground is a staking pool where they put their monsters and tokens to level up the monsters while receiving more tokens passively."
1203186,I have seen a doses of creativity
1203185,
1203184,"Q4 from Telegram user   @meml97
It caught my attention that on your roadmap says that before the release of the game on QIV 2021 you will be releasing “Training Ground and Monster Nest”, so, with that in mind can you tell us more about this future feature? What exact functions will they have? By their names I could guess this features will help players on their journey throughout Demole but how much exactly will this Training Ground and Monster Nest help them and what do players need to do to fully enjoy Training Ground and Monster Nest? What benefits will players receive by using this two features and how could said features provide any kind of growth development to the game itself?"
1203183,Sure
1203182,Compared to the other games right
1203181,How affordable it is
1203180,"Thank you for your answers, Rae! Ready to go to the next question?😀"

1203173,
1203172,"Btw, will users who won't be able to participate in IDO be able to play? Will they need to invest to start playing?"
1203171,Ask your friends to join haha
1203170,And PvP is when you are no longer alone

1203159,
1203158,"It's so beautiful that everyone we have seen any Arts, and Design; I am just totally stunned"
1203157,"Tbh, the most exciting parts of Demole for both developers and users in Demole is about the 3D design"
1203156,
1203155,can you explain for newbies what these - PvP and PvE ?
1203154,"For PvP mode, stay tuned for our in-game exciting Arena Mode. We will update everything on our channel soon how exciting it will be"
1203153,Most of the games do have PvE so we think we are not out of the differences
1203152,😊😊
1203151,"Q3 from Telegram user  @Lestmarisv13
With a Diverse PvP and PvE gameplay to win, Demole is the first playable 3D RPG in the crypto / NFT ecosystem.

1203123,
1203122,actually this is the next question
1203121,Everything will be early and intensive for our community
1203120,When do you expect your IDO? Can you give us some details about it?
1203118,"IDO and IGO upcoming is def what we are looking for but most importantly, GAME LAUNCH"
1203117,"Hm, yes, you need successful start😀 what is biggest and most important event you're waiting for?"
1203116,
1203115,"As mentioned, this is not our 1st project so we do want to keep our credential for many more upcoming projects"
1203114,where it ensures not only inner team workflow but also users' experience
1203113,"2nd of all, we have strong experts and gurus within team so sticking to a plan is A MUST"
1203112,That's true!
1203111,Most of the other games which failed is bc they do not focus evenly on both sides (of either focused on game des or finance)
1203110,"First of all, we were starting as a VCs, not solo team, at the beginning where we acquired so many successful projects; so for Demole, we build a strong financial and game des internally right at the beginning"
1203109,Take your time 😀
1203108,Wow let me break it into small part
1203107,"Q1 from Telegram user  @MinxOxyde
I have already played at many blockchain game, some of those game with their own tokenomic has failed to fulfill the users wants, for example some of this game do not strict to their own roadmap and ignore the demand of their players, also some of those game failed in their launching and sell too many packs of NFT at first, also too many bug on the game, for the result too many whale in the game and make the game economic not balance, and many players run out because of that,,,,what about Demole it self? what will you do regarding to this issue? because the good looking game like Demole have to support by good tokenomic ecosystem too…"
1203106,
1203105,Are you ready for the first part of our AMA?🚀
1203104,"Rae, thank you for this intro! After it i am really intrigued to see your answers to the questions from our community 😀"
1203103,
1203102,😉 got it!
1203101,We have not had the plan to consoles. But who knows 😊
1203100,
1203099,do you planning release also on consoles? 🙃
1203098,So check it out
1203097,We have specifically stated it out the timeline development in our channel
1203096,"Good question, PC will go first then Mobile will come later, but not so far"
1203095,"To summarize, this is perfect game for both gamers and investors"
1203094,"We divide in-game spending into 4 parts:
- Burning - This will benefit the investors
- Part will go to the team as fund for develop the future features
- In-game rewards - The more people spend, the bigger reward for every gamer"
1203093,It will be available on both pc and mobile from the beginning?
1203092,"Last but not least, we have a strict revenue distribution mechanism"
1203091,"Second of all, the game is ENTIRELY 3D and will be featured on both PC and MOBILE (which a lot other games dont have, only PC avail)"
1203090,"Understand about this, We have brought in professional financial teams who will build the model and observe the ecosystem on the daily basis."
1203089,"As you may well-seen from the market, Many NFT games (which I would not want to cite their name specifically) have dead ends because their financial models were more suitable for traditional games than for NFT games - where token values and in-game asset inflation 
rate are crucial."
1203088,The first one is Financial model
1203087,"As you know, 3D NFT Game is on the hype recently. When we started, we analyzed SWOT analysis carefully to work on 3 main things that made us soon-to-be pioneer in the market"

1202569,"Yes, $XMS is a volatility token, but the XMS token is not the only mainstay of USDM. USDM is backed by all assets within the Mars Treasury. XMS only creates a support ratio for USDM. With this created support ratio, as the use of USDM increases, the value of XMS will necessarily increase. As a result, even though XMS is a volatility token, USDM is backed by whitelisted tokens & coins within the Mars Treasury."

1202558,7 Q to go
1202557,"Astrophysicist Guillem Anglada Escudé once said “Space inspires mankind, promotes the integration of various disciplines, and promotes the reflection of the whole society on the earth.”The vision of going to Mars does not mean abandoning earth, but expanding our journey to include both planets. The exploration of the red planet may even help us better solve the earth's energy crisis and protect life here. 

""We may carry out extra-terrestrial mining and even introduce the development of a multi-planet economy. "" - ESA. 

Logically, no company will carry gold coins or paper money to Mars, because this will greatly increase the extra weight of neccasary material delivered. In turn, this is a very inefficient way of transferring currency value.

Cryptocurrency will therefore become the best choice for interstellar exploration. Before humans set foot on Mars, begin to mine energy, and establish civilization, it may be possible to issue a currency that can be easily traded on Mars or even across planets."

1202555,"Our main liquidity is currently in Mars Swap. https://app.marsecosystem.com/swap You can use the $XMS token here. Be sure to use BNB or BUSD at the time of purchase, currently we only have liquidity for these 2 tokens/coins. More will be added in the future. $XMS is the governance token of the Mars Ecosystem. The $XMS token will be used in the future Mars DAO. Also, $XMS has a support ratio for $USDM. Thus, it will be able to limit the minting amount of $USDM."

However, superficially, it will be as follows, users (who want to be the first owner of USDM) will commit BUSD at Genesis Launch, thus earning USDM and XMS as a reward. For example, a user who commits 100BUSD will receive 100 USDM and XMS reward in proportion to the user's participation percentage. PS.: 5% of the total supply of XMS will be distributed through this event."

1202208,it will really help regulation
1202207,So can you share your Tokenomics with us?
1202206,As much as I can.. 😊
1202205,This is detailed enough.. 👏
1202204,"Here's how asymmetric minting and redeeming works: To mint USDM token, the user must add one of the Mars Treasury whitelisted assets to the Mars Treasury. For example, the user can mint 5 USDM with $5 ETH. However, when the user wants to redeem 5 USDM, XMS token is given to the user instead of ETH. Thus, antisymmetric minting is provided. In addition, assets in the Mars Treasury will support the value of USDM and XMS. Finally, thanks to Support Ratio, USDM's market cap will be limited by XMS's market cap. This will reflect positively on the price of XMS. 

In short, thanks to the anti-minting and redeeming mechanism, the spiral of death is prevented.

When USDM market price > $1:
Arbitrageurs can use $1 worth of the Mars Treasury whitelisted assets (such as BTC) to mint 1 USDM in the Mars Treasury, They can then sell the newly minted USDM in the market to make a profit. This arbitrage action will quickly bring the market price of USDM back to $1.


When  USDM market price < $1: 
Arbitrageurs can buy 1 USDM in the market for less than $1 and then redeem it in the Mars Treasury to obtain $1 worth of XMS. The redeemed XMS can be sold in the market to make a profit. As long as XMS has sufficient liquidity in the market, this arbitrage action will quickly bring the market price of USDM back to $1."
1202203,Great question. It is a good opportunity to highlight the difference of USDM from other stablecoins.
1202202,"Q3 from Telegram User @Highpee

One of the features that you have introduced to ensure your stablecoin stability is an anti-bank run mechanism which you said can prevent large sell-off of stablecoin within a short period. Can you explain how you will maintain stability of USDM and how you will be able to prevent large sell off especially during situations where users may be apprehensive that the price may not return to $1? How do your asymmetry minting and redeeming process work and how does it prevent death spiral event or sell-off run under extreme market conditions?"
1202201,Yes please.

1202182,"Currently, our farms and pools have come to life. Last September, the main focus of the dev team was adding more farms and pools. We have added many farms and pools in line with the requests of our users. The team's current focus is on Genesis Launch. After the Genesis Launch is complete, there will be usage details. Also, we will distribute NFT to all IMO holders. We are currently improving the NFT gameplay and empowerment. We will cooperate with other projects as well. Please give us some time, since we 're trying to explore more value and possibilities. Stay tuned with Mars for the news!"
1202181,"Q2 from Telegram User @Pavel_Jarosh

Masr Ecosystem includes multiple pieces of puzzle: Mars Treasury, Minting Control, DeFi protocols, governance token. There’s also a place for NFT project, however it is not described in details as above mentioned initiatives. Please let us know what is in heart of Mars NFT? Can they be bought or you plan to distribute them as part of rewarding system? Thank you!"
1202180,"Yes, I am ready."

1202173,When is the genesis launch scheduled to take place?
1202172,Thanks for great answers 😊
1202171,"Our team has a plan for NFTs in the future. However, the team is currently looking to head towards farms and the Genesis Launch. Therefore, we can expect such visual enhancements in the future."

1202169,unique feature👏👏👏
1202168,
1202167,"The main features that make the Mars Ecosystem unique are Mars Treasury, Mars DeFi, and Mars Stablecoin. By combining these 3 features under a single ecosystem, we aim to offer the most useful and safe platform for users. The main purpose of the Mars Ecosystem is to create the DeFi central bank. The stablecoin it will use while doing this is USDM. Behind USDM are  BTC, ETH, UNI, etc. major coins. In this way, USDM will be both a decentralized and sustainable stablecoin."
1202166,😉
1202165,Great and detailed question.
1202164,"Q1 from Telegram user @Orlemys   

We've somehow gotten past the ""to-the-moon"" rage, and now many projects are stepping into other planets, with Mars being at the center of it all. So, how do you manage to stand out from the Mars protocols crowd? What are the unique traits that make your Mars ecosystem authentic? Are you focused more on the Mars visuals and space, or on releasing products and community rewards?"
1202163,
1202162,"Yep, I am ready!"
1202161,"Thanks for great introduction, we have several questions which were selected for the 1st part. Ready to start?"
1202160,"Our team is anonymous, as with many DeFi projects. Our team wants to highlight itself with the work it does and the product it develops."
1202159,
1202158,Yes exactly!  Everyone on the team strives to help each other.
1202157,Is your team anonymous or not?
1202156,Wow! Real dream team🔥
1202155,It's always great to have dedicated people working as a Team...
1202154,"Of course. John is the founder and CEO of Mars Ecosystem. He is an avid fan and researcher of DeFi. He has not only studied a PhD in Finance at Stanford University, but also have many years of experience in the financial industry.

Also, there are ~20 community and marketing manager in our team in total. They are doing their best for the development of the project.

And, our developer team is very hardworking, they aim to offer the best product by working as a team non-stop for the project to come to the best place."

1202152,please tell us about the team. who are these amazing people who make up the core of the team?
1202151,Thanks to vesting mechanism.

1200712,Thank you very much @AOIXS and @Darrenkhye for your time!
1200711,good trivia question there!
1200710,"10/10🚀

@ciupidos help us please with Quiz part😊"
1200709,This actually comes from rebranding of our digital assets platform called InvestaX that has been up since 2015 :)
1200708,And there’s 1️⃣ more question left to pick… 🔥
1200707,"This is why we are created IX Swap and these new asset classes in the first place.  Many new individuals come on to the blockchain space and get burnt and slaughtered by the volatility  of the unregulated market.
This is where securities come in to ensure that these assets are facilated in a regulated environment to allow new users to access regulated assets in forms of tokens, that are issued by real world businesses and use-cases. This ensures that new individuals are not blindly coming in to unregulated products but products vetted by licensed entities.   This is so much easier for new in crypto to be familiar with in a safer environment

please check out ixswap.io"
1200706,
1200705,We expect a similar effect on the current STO market which portrays many similar characteristics to how DEXes were like prior to AMM models
1200704,
1200703,IXS is currently available on Kucoin and on Uniswap. There will be more trading venues going forward so stay tuned 🙂
1200702,
1200701,"Definitely, we have already launched and have our tokens listed on kucoin and uniswap!  :)
 please do refer to our litepaper and website. It is all stated ixswap.io"
1200700,
1200699,
1200698,
1200697,"Before i answer this question,  i would like to highlight that there are differernt types of digital assets.  there are traded securities and non-traded securities.
With traded securities, we already have partner oracles that we have tied up with and announced. For these, pricing is taken from our established partners/ oracles that provide data feeds for pricing, allowing these traded securities to be traded with little inefficiencies in a regulated defi environment

for non-traded securities, our AMM models on our platform is geared towards price discovery in a fair market. This allows for the underlying to grow and find its market price in the open market or anyone that has access to our platform. In this case, we will be creating a new set of Data feeds for STOs!  This is where IX swap will also be a data centre to feed back to the open market and oracles for this new asset classes"
1200696,
1200695,IX Swap is blockchain agnostic. Meaning that we will be connecting with any protcols that support or want to build an STO ecosystem. We started on ETH because 99% of all STOs in the market right now were built on ETH. We expect many more STO issuances across multiple chains going forward and we will be integrating with them as our platform develops
1200694,
1200693,The key issue with binance and their stock tokens was they were not a regulated company but they were dealing with tokenized stocks which are regulated products (securities). IX Swap is dealing with licensed broker-dealers in counrties where they are permitted to deal with the securities. The key highlight of this really is Binance’s acceptance of security tokens and this is really just the start of a new asset class on the blockchain
1200692,9️⃣ more questions to go
1200691,"At the moment staking and liquidity mining is already up on our platform. Feel free to check out the different pools and APR. When we have STOs ready on the platform, rewards will mostly be in IXS. This is due to the constrains of a security, but possibility for rewards in STO, should the user be whitelisted by our licensed partner and issue. Though right now our native token and rewards and fees is on IXS, concentrating the demand for our token for hodlers :)"

1200034,Friends! Thanks for your answers! Please share useful links with our community before opening a chat.
1200033,Glad to be here! Want to thank your community for their time taken to listen in :)
1200032,
1200031,Thank you very much for the clear answers @AOIXS and @Darrenkhye! You’ve been truly superb so far! 😉
1200030,Which adds an extra layer of security to our system 😉
1200029,Yes and I think one more important thing to note is that we are using 3rd party custodians for our STOs
1200028,"Safety is a very felt concern in the crypto space, it’s really great and relieving to read that you’ve aptly anticipated the issue and have already taken care of that 🚀"
1200027,A sound 100 score - thank you for sharing guys 🔥
1200026,https://twitter.com/IxSwap/status/1434019375766544384
1200025,We had done one with Zokyo just recently
1200024,We will not be releasing any products without proper audits 🙂
1200023,We will be constantly going through audits as we develop the platform
1200022,"By the way, safety is so important for the users as well. Have you been audited - or is the auditing process underway (or planned for the near future) as we speak?"
1200021,Absolutely🚀
1200020,
1200019,
1200018,"The more we grow and expand with partners that add value to the ecosystem, the stronger the adoption of STOs will be!"
1200017,smart idea😁
1200016,We are providing a completely new asset class to the copy traders and other users of the IX Swap platform would be able to “copy” the trades or investments of more successful traders
1200015,We are increasing our user base of traders & investors as they would be able to access our platform to execute these trades. This will create overall awareness of our platform and grow our community organically.
1200014,"Interesting this came up. Seems like your community is up to date with our developments!

Alpha Impact, being a copy trading platform, has a large community of traders that would provide growth to the IXS Community."
1200013,"Dear community, we will open the chat soon. Please prepare your questions. IX Swap team will select 10 of them. Please remember the rules ❗️❗️❗️

-Only genuine questions will be rewarded. Copied questions will be disqualified
Read the rules here
 (https://t.me/Satoshi_club/272142)-For Part 2 of the AMA, every user will be allowed to post maximum 3 questions. One message should contain maximum 1 question. If you post more than 3 questions, you will not receive the reward if selected. Thank you for understanding and good luck!😉
Also, don't forget to join @ixswapofficial"
1200012,"**Q6 from Telegram User @ItsMelissa3**

A few days ago you announced a strategic cooperation with Alpha impact, which is a copy-trading social media platform. What common goal do you have with this partnership? What benefits does IX Swap receive by partnering with Alpha Impact? How does a market leading copy trading platform and a market leading digital security DEX complement each other? How can both ecosystems benefit?"
1200011,"This is the last question for this very first part of the AMA, then we’re heading into the LIVE part of the session 🔥"
1200010,"I concur, thank you very much!"
1200009,100%
1200008,perfect answer👍
1200007,"I personally believe that being fully regulatory compliant on a worldwide, international scale will give you an edge over *any* competitor in the market 😉"
1200006,Great 🚀
1200005,
1200004,"With this structure, IX Swap will be massively scalable through connecting with as many licensed partners to allow platforms now and in the future to connect in an environment that is regulatory compliant to grow into the future of finance"
1200003,"As being platform agnostic, IX Swap’s reach is global, however with that said, our gatekeepers for checks and balances relies on our local licensed entity or entities that connect with our ecosystem to allow their STO to be ported to our custodians to be facilitated on the IX Swap platform.These STO’s will already be regulatory compliant as they are already launched in their jurisdictions as a capital markets products. Hence each of these STOs incorporate the legal framework of where the security is being issued from, with the limitations of who can also trade them, based on the KYC and whitelist provided by each regulatory body."
1200002,The IX Swap platform is being built to be regulatory compliant and seeks to combine the innovations of the financial and technological efficiencies to build a tokenized future of finance.
1200001,"Yes that is correct, paper, token, it doesn't matter, what we’re dealing with are securities and we are bound by the securities laws based on our licensed partners ability to operate."
1200000,"**Q5 from Telegrams User @Josegamboac**

Having a security, does not change its underlying, in which they still have to be within the limits of the current legal frameworks. IXSWAP builds the bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies, since both worlds must be understood to be able to integrate towards the improvement of each industry. How hard in terms of law-abiding and financial efforts, is it for IXSWAP to be built online within regulatory constraints to allow the financial sector to grow into the future of finance? Do you believe this will be the key, differentiating factor against your competitors? How heavily will you rely on this aspect as a competing strategy?"
1199999,ready when you are!
1199997,Ready to continue?
1199996,
1199995,Thanks for your answers
1199994,Gold words❤️
1199993,Always be grateful to those that support you :)
1199992,Mass adoption will be much more comfortable with you😁
1199991,"So if we aren’t already, we hope to be in your local jurisdictions soon!"
1199990,"Hence, really grateful for our core community especially the ones that have been with us from the start! We have always encouraged the communities to share where we lack presence and engage the community in the manner of games and giveaways whilst educating the community to take on the future of finance."
1199989,This is very commendable👏
1199988,Gotta love the long-term view behind your answer 🚀
1199987,"Growing the communities organically takes time, building a solid community that gives us good feedback and value add takes even longer as the members of the core team wish to interact and hear the voices of our community."
1199986,"Definitely!! IX Swap aims to be a global platform that is all-inclusive and jurisdiction agnostic. Plans to grow non-english and non-crypto communities are already under way, both for translation to the local community, and also to understand the issues they face locally with the current traditional financial system, be it availability to products or to assisting the unbanked."
1199985,"The community is foundational, isn't it? 😁"
1199984,Ah! one for the community ! 👍
1199983,"**Q4 from Telegram User @Tahsinahmett**

Today, communities can not only provide interesting ideas to projects, but also bring them in large partnerships. What is the importance and value that IXSWAP project gives to communities? What ways do you follow to increase the awareness of IXSWAP in different regions and spread your project more? It is a big market for non-crypto and non-English-speaking projects, IXSWAP is from this market. What are they doing to benefit?"
1199982,lets go 👌
1199981,Ready for the next question?
1199980,Thanks for your great answers 😃
1199979,Yes lots of brain power going into this project 😄
1199978,"as we can see, you have thought through all the scenarios very well 😁"
1199977,It's really make a sense😉
1199976,This would be a great scenario😁
1199975,With regards to your query on what if IL doesnt occur the IL fund will remain untouched if IL does not occur
1199974,"Yes that is correct! We will have a cap on payments to any particular pool as to ensure the funds are sufficiently distirbuted and will be dependent on bunch of factors relating to the asset trading within the pool ie. volatility presented (IL tends to increase as volatility increases), liquidity provision, arbitrage opportunities."
1199973,
1199972,😎
1199971,"**Q3 from Telegram User @Rotoxy
**
IX Swap has set up an IL Insurance mechanism to reduce the effect of Impermanent loss on liquidity providers. This include 8% from ecosystem fund, 5% from trading fees and 50% from penalty. How is this insurance shared among individual Liquidity providers in situations where Impermanent Loss actually occurs?
What happens to the fund if IL does not occur?"
1199970,Thanks 😄
1199969,Btw next question comes. and it will be a continuation of this conversation if you do not mind
1199968,you are really very cool! and it's unique😁
1199967,🔥
1199966,"Lovely, thank you very much! 🙏 Crystal-clear explanation 🚀"
1199965,"On top of this, The IXS tokens also have a distinct deflationary economics function to ensure value is created for our token holders the more the platform is used.
5% of Fees will be sent to a permanently locked vault reducing the overall token supply.
5% of Fees will also be sent to a vault to purchase IXS tokens.
Rewards earned on the platform will be distributed over time to ensure token inflation is reduced.

These factors will create a deflationary effect on tokens the more the platform is used."
1199964,"So here are the features of the IXS tokens - 
IXS token holders will be able to stake their tokens on IX Swap to receive an interest rate as income. Platform earnings in the future will also be distributed to IXS token holders

IXS token holders will also be able to stake their tokens for governance related to the activity of IX Swap - this will allow token holders to take part in the active growth and decision making of IX Swap

IXS token holders will also receive priority access to new STO issuances on the InvestaX primary STO issuance platform."
1199963,"Just before we get into that, the IXS token is a utility token NOT a security token. It will be freely available to trade on any cryptocurrency exchange or DEX."
1199962,
1199961,"If you have a tokenomics paper/infographic to share, I guess this is the perfect moment to do so 😉"
1199960,sounds interesting👍
1199959,Could you share with our Satoshi Clubbers some of the $IXS use-cases?
1199958,"Other than governance, we know you have crafted quite some tasty utilities for holding the $IXS token"
1199957,Great 🔥🔥🔥
1199956,look out for further announcements too!
1199955,good to go sir :)
1199954,"On top of that, as we are developing the economic models for each asset class that IX Swap supports, holders will be able to influence the economic models that are able to configure that confines which the asset classes operate under, allowing holders to dictate fair market, to reduce the number of inefficiencies and arbitrage opportunities as each asset class evolves through the Defi space. This will allow STOs on  IX Swap to always stay relevant."
1199953,"As you have mentioned we are dealing with regulatory bodies and as such, not all aspects of the company will be governed by the token holders."
1199952,"The token holders will be able to vote on rewards, benefits, IXS supported pools and we would look to allow the token holders to have more influence over the governance as the platform develops."
1199951,"**Q2 from Telegram User @Highpee
**
You plan to introduce On-chain governance capabilities for managing and implementing changes within the IX Swap protocol using $IXS. As a regulatory conscious and licensed token focused project, to what extent will users be able to vote for changes and implement proposals on your protocols? What are the decisions that you will allow holders to directly influence, suggests, manage and vote on? How will your governance be carried out and how will you ensure a fair representation of every ones opinions in the execution of platform policies?"
1199950,Next topic: governance 😁
1199949,bring it :)
1199948,Ready to proceed to the next question?🚀
1199947,Thanks for detailed answers
1199946,
1199945,
1199944,Security token offerings are the IPO of the future
1199943,I can definitely see how STOs are more accessible to smaller investors and firms and that's a huge advantage in favor of your value proposition 😉
1199942,IPOs definitely!
1199941,"Considering what you're building,do you guys believe that ICOs and IPOs will be replaced by their digital, on-chain equivalent in the future?"
1199940,
1199939,😂
1199938,Hahaha 😁
1199937,And thats how STOs are  > than CTOs   💩
1199936,"Hence, we aren’t only targeting investors of crypto or STO’s but the actual issues of these securities to paving the way to a tokenized future and financial markets"
1199935,"The strength of the STO markets as a whole also relies heavily on the education and adoption of the financial sector. This means going on the ground and having close relationships with institutions that are forward thinking that want to participate and build the space with us . We have very good relationships with the institutions in Singapore, which is also a global financial hub, some of which have been speaking to us for years in the development of STOs. Our partners are also close with the regulatory authorities here, and are building blockchain products and platforms for the financial sector in the regulatory sandbox."
1199934,Lol😜
1199933,"The STO market currently does not have any market makers or a highly liquid secondary market and moreover, provides incentives for providing liquidity which is currently not available in the securities market. IXS plans to start liquidity mining programs in the future to attract STO token holders."
1199932,"Haha yeah, let me correct the typo 😁"
1199931,I think you meant STO instead of CTO. 😉
1199930,"**Q1 from Telegram User @Pavel_Jarosh
**
As per your Litepaper, IX Swap will be creating the first liquidity pools by allowing STO token holders to stake their tokens to become liquidity providers. This means that the success of the whole project depends on the community, as much customers you get the more sophisticated and powerful IX Swap system we get. What is your “Plan B” once the number of STO token holders is not growing or even drops for a certain period of time? How would you fullfill your “tanks” with liquidity? Thank you!"
1199929,
1199928,Bring it!
1199927,
1199926,😁🚀
1199925,Are you guys ready? 😉
1199924,"Thanks for great introduction, we have several questions which were selected for the 1st part. Ready to start?"
1199923,We will be fleshing out all the details with our community questions next!
1199922,Indeed! 😄
1199921,That's right .. lack of liquidity is a real problem.
1199920,"Great introduction guys, thank you very much 🔥"
1199919,Also the lack of availability of STOs on Binance and UniSwap means that there is currently very little liquidity in the market.
1199918,many thanks for the clarification! now all the advantages are obvious to me 👏👏👏
1199917,"Right on, IX Swap might potentially be filling a huge market gap at the moment 😉"
1199916,"However, because we are integrated with licensed intermediaries we have the ability to trade these tokens classified as securities and these exiled tokens are welcome to find a home at IX Swap."
1199915,"The main difference between us and our competitors is that we are working with licensed intermediaries and trading with actual security tokens that have claims over real world assets and not just synthetic positions. When you are trading securities, a license will be required. This is how securities are dealt with now and that’s just the way it is."
1199914,It’s great that you have asked this. This is actually quite relevant due to the recent news that Binance and Uniswap had taken down some tokens because they did not have security licenses and these tokens were considered securities/security tokens. Just because you create a synthetic version of an asset doesn't mean they lose their tag as securities.
1199913,Tell us about main benefits of IX Swap. How is it different from others?
1199912,
1199911,This infographic is worth more than a thousand words 😉
1199910,
1199909,really excited for these :)
1199908,IX Swap Beta version of the platform will be released in 4Q2021 and expect the platform to be fully functional by 1Q2022.
1199907,"Here are current plans . feel free to have a look at our litepaper and website

IXswap.io"
1199906,Well we have lots of exciting announcements that will unveal over the coming weeks 🙂
1199905,"Actually the story of IX Swap goes way further back. We have spent over 6 years developing the STO ecosystem infrastructure to build an end-to-end security token issuance company, and IX Swap then became the next stage of this STO infrastructure that we embarked to build. We started the IX Swap project early in the year and have been hard at work developing the platform.

The birth of IX Swap came as a necessary infrastructure solution to close the loop for the STO ecosystem."
1199904,
1199903,Yes we are doing something new and completely different from the regular projects you see in the crypto space 🙂
1199902,How long does it take to develop a project? What plans do you have for the future? And what can we expect from   IX Swap
1199900,"Thank you very much for sharing, I always feel relieved it comes to a project being open and transparent - not a thing to take for granted in the crypto space 😁"
1199899,Done ✅
1199898,the direction really has no outspoken leaders yet! I hope that you will become them
1199897,https://www.linkedin.com/company/ixswap
1199896,"We were cautious when hiring new team members because we wanted the right mix of people from both the traditional and the new crypto world to build this out. The IX Swap team consists of entrepreneurs, capital markets, legal and blockchain experts. We are also publishing our job applications on Linkedin so be sure to follow us there!"
1199895,Regarding our team. We are currently over 20 team members now; the teams’ profiles are available on Linkedin and our website
1199894,The platform will be the first DeFi platform to facilitate the trading of security tokens through licensed custodians and security brokers which will provide actual ownership and claim over these real world assets.
1199893,IX Swap will be the FIRST platform to provide liquidity pools and automated market making functions for the security token (STO) & tokenized stock industry (TSO).
1199892,That said its a little more complicated than that
1199891,"So in the simplest way we could explain it, IX Swap is the ""Uniswap"" of the STO/TSO industry"
1199890,And also we would like to know more about your team. Who is on the project team core?😊
1199889,"Now onto IX Swap, please give our Satoshi Clubbers a brief introduction about the project 😉"
1199888,Hahaha let's call it fate then 😁
1199887,👊
1199886,Really promising🔥👏
1199885,it was inevitable with the common love of crypto and STOs :)
1199884,Love the tag teaming 🙂 How did you meet each other for the first time?
1199883,great background😁👏
1199882,"way too quickly haha,, didnt even give STOs a chance to shine"
1199881,"With the STO market heating up more in the past year than before, we are excited to be guiding the space to new heights!

Buckle up for the exciting times ahead!

I will be leading the team in listings and partnerships"
1199880,"During my first start-up stint in VR for real estate, I discovered the use of blockchain that fully fascinated me, which led me to my 2nd start up. Setting up my Blockchain Consultancy and accelerator since the later part of 2017, allowed me to see and unlocking the potential of blockchain in various industries, which natural let me back to want to solve the inefficiencies in traditional finance and to be able set precedence to create a whole segment for the future finance."
1199879,2017 ended too quickly 😂
1199878,"Hi Everyone! My name is Darren and I am the Head of Asset listings and strategic partnerships here at IX Swap. Given my past experience in finance and real estate, along with co-founding 2 start ups in tech and in blockchain, the road that led me here was inevitable. My background in finance provided exposure to a vast selection of products from within investment banking and private banking working with both large corporates and high net work individuals. This allowed me to understand both the efficiencies and inefficiencies in the financial system."
1199877,We’re just getting started this time.
1199876,"The crypto markets were extremely volatile but offered a plethora of opportunities and offered an open architecture which was the complete opposite to what I was experiencing at the bank. After years of being fed up and frustrated with traditional banking practices, I left the bank and pursued my interest in the blockchain space working with digital securities, security tokens and crypto. IXS & Security tokens were a natural evolution for me given my experience in traditional finance and love for crypto."
1199875,"hot crypto 2017🔥 ... reminds me of 2021, doesn't it? 😅"
1199873,My background has primarily been in traditional finance and banking working in investment advisory across multiple large private banks. During my time in the banking industry I was extremely fascinated by the crypto industry and started trading and arbitraging crypto markets back in 2017.
1199872,Hi everyone! My name is Aaron and I am one of the Co-founders of IX Swap.
1199871,Sure!
1199870,"Let's start! Introduce yourself please. How did you get to be involved in crypto & IX Swap
Tell us please about your position in  IX Swap"
1199869,Yeah🔥
1199868,Haha right 😁

1199781,Yes hopefully
1199778,Hello guys
1199775,Let's see how 2021 ends
1199774,just look and wait
1199773,there are many predictions
1199772,yes that's why i tell you
1199767,And etc until goal achieved
1199766,Maybe will move to plan C
1199765,If plan B not working also
1199764,Yes I think so
1199763,Plan A is BTC hit $350K by December
1199762,Yes maybe true
1199761,It's about prediction
1199754,👍
1199753,but be careful
1199752,while it is favorable to you
1199751,you can use any plan
1199750,Hi
1199749,Hola bb sms me my inbox
1199748,Try with plan c 🤔🤔🤔
1199747,What to do if both plans not working
1199746,😂😂😂

1199744,For me plan a not working
1199743,🙄
1199742,Jesus make me rich
1199741,Daily go to church and pray
1199740,Yes pray
1199738,Plan b

1199736,hello
1199735,fine thanks !
1199734,l'm okie how about you
1199733,🤔🤔
1199732,see how the market moves
1199731,we only have to look
1199730,that really only GOD knows
1199729,I trust with what dice
1199728,how are you today !!!
1199727,Hi
1199726,👋🏼👋🏼
1199725,Hello !!!
1199724,and it works for them
1199723,to panic and sell
1199722,that instill fear
1199721,they only give news
1199720,How do we know if they will fall or not
1199719,HeyEvening jermalyn
1199718,Or a dream
1199717,Maybe predictions tend to be a wish
1199716,Good evening to all
1199715,https://t.me/wagglenetwork/87451
1199714,It's only predictions
1199713,so anything can happen
1199712,not all the time will go up
1199711,the market is volatile
1199710,everything is possible
1199709,Yes hopefully you are right also
1199708,No one knows
1199707,But once again
1199706,Maybe will affect at btc also
1199705,I hearr November stock will crash
1199704,but none of them are right
1199703,every day numbers
1199702,with precision
1199701,Then in December will hit $100K
1199700,it is not known where it will arrive
1199699,the truth is that you are right
1199698,after last dip out
1199697,Maybe November BUT
1199696,Yes predictions from experts
1199695,years ago
1199694,I have listening to the btc in 100k
1199693,but many are wrong
1199692,always predictions say
1199691,could also be back down to 30k
1199690,We only pray and hope
1199689,Only God knows anyway
1199688,Everybody only guessing
1199687,But who knows
1199686,Even plan B says will hit $200K
1199685,🆗
1199684,Many articles says like that
1199683,Yes I think so
1199682,but I don't know where it will end
1199681,i think i will break your ath
1199680,and still does not know 70k
1199679,still hard 50k
1199678,100k is still a high value
1199677,you think i will achieve 100k in december
1199676,Dyor is important
1199675,That's my options anyway
1199674,Plan A working properly
1199673,Because in Q4 BTC strong bullish
1199672,Big dump will never see anymore
1199671,But correction actually
1199670,Not big dump
1199669,I think no
1199668,they are only coins
1199667,if something like
1199666,Maybe need years to meet bears
1199665,Bearish still so long distance
1199664,So it will pump massively
1199663,My guess
1199662,Yes once 100K
1199661,A big dump will happen
1199660,So plan A must be higher
1199659,Once 100k
1199658,Because plan B say BTC will hit $250K
1199657,$100k also programmed
1199656,Or maybe more then $100K
1199655,Btc will hit $100K by December
1199654,It's programmed by whales
1199653,Yes your right
1199652,Yes watching calmly
1199651,I mean right now
1199650,👏👏👏
1199649,Just chill right noe
1199648,Ok
1199647,No need worry anyway
1199646,It's normal in crypto
1199645,Bad for alt holders
1199644,Yes after pump so dump
1199643,Alts are bleeding
1199642,Enough to push the market
1199641,Btc will break out again tomorrow
1199640,Bulls should be strong
1199639,Having said that
1199638,They are still in long distance
1199637,Bears are weak now
1199636,No need worry about bears
1199635,Yes
1199634,Bear still far
1199633,And move forward
1199632,To break
1199631,It's only bear trap
1199630,This correction should be good for us
1199629,Tend to uptrend
1199628,Because BTC looks bullish
1199627,Hope everything is fine
1199626,Let's see
1199625,Btc start to pump again tomorrow
1199624,For your analysis
1199623,Everything will be ok
1199622,Thank you
1199621,No need panic
1199620,It's normal
1199619,Btc healthy correction

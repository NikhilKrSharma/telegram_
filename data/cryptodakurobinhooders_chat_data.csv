1380381,"Token buy back and MM will be done to ensure price stability for our users, this is done automatically via a smart contract that feeds signals from oracles outside as well as directly on our marketplace"
1380380,"Token Rev model:
Players need to own real estate to progress through the game, which means they need to buy $HIGH either on an exchange or swap with $STREET that they earn which will increase buy pressure on exchanges 
Players need to purchase equipment in game, either brand affiliated products in which we take 4-9% Transaction fee on every purchase. Think of us as a new type of e-commerce channel for brands 
Players need to purchase items like food and drinks to replenish their health in game, some of these are virtual products that we sell which will be pure profit for us, some are affiliated with a brand, Halal guys food truck for example will be present in which players can redeem the sauce."
1380378,"The vision for us is to build a decentralized metaverse where brands can seamlessly integrate their products into our game. And I don’t mean just product placement, but actually write the products into the lore of the game. We got this multi island system where each island has a different ecology, different monsters, some are underwater, floating in the air, inside of volcanos, really its really designed to be complete whack so any brand can have a place in Highstreet. Updates in original interview questions above ~"
1380377,"1. Tokenized NFTs divide real products in 2 portions, digital in game objects and the physical product itself, this first portion is pure profit for brands.
2. Built in gaze tracking system to study behavior giving brands live consumer behaviour data with regards to product interactions.
3. Players can finally embody their game avatars in real life, if you like what your character’s wearing and using, you redeem it in real life."
1380373,"1. Alt asset traders no longer need to deal with logistics, as only tokens are exchanged 
 2. Alt asset traders no longer need to find a buyer before selling, liquidity is constant with the bonding curve, since deposits aside from fees are stored in a smart contract vault 
 3. Collectors redeem product by burning token and brands ship products to them directly, no more fraud 
 4. Automated price discovery for new brands 
 5. for as long as the product trades for, brands can continue making money based on transaction fees we collect on every buy and sell."

1379114,all vouchers convert on a 1to1 basis to tokens post TGE
1379113,these vouchers can be used to buy our drop 0 on highstreet.market
1379112,We've already allowed our community to access High ahead of TGE using vouchers they get from our vault after acquiring a fomoduck nft fromhttps://www.foreverfomoducksquad.com/
1379108,we have a two token system where High is governance and Street is going to be more day to day in game currency
1379107,"we had 3 rounds of investment 
Family and Friends early on to help us get started with a 500k raise @ 5M cap. These guys will have a 15% release a month after TGE, remaining vesting over 2 years 

We then had a round of institutional investors join us with a 1.5M raise @ 15M Cap
Most recently to help accelerate time to market we had another institutional round with a 3M raise @ 30M cap. 
Both institutional rounds have a initial release of 15-18% respectively and vesting over 2 years 

Our public sale is next week with Polkastarter (500k total at 1 dollar)on the 11th and Impossible Finance(1M total at 1 dollar) on the 13th where 50% will be unlocked upfront and 50% in 4 months."

1379092,"Our team is diverse as well, besisdes myself being a crypto native, we have others who joined from very estblaished projects like NEM and Proton. We have core members who are Ex Sotheby's and Mckinsey who brings a more structured outlook to our gunslinger culture of game developers. The teams been working together for over 6 years now so we understand our strengths and weaknesses quite well and can help each other cover"
1379091,
1379090,"our advisors bring us beyond crypto  too, Jaeson Ma, founder of Triller and 88Rising throws us our celebrity star power and endless streams of influencers for product integration, Matt Cheng from Cherubic was a professoinal tennis player before so helps us with our athletic brand and world connects, then of course we have HTC with the integration side and Metaplex on the crypto end where we're designing a new type of portal that allow merchants to easily setup shop both on web3 and in the metaverse as easily as they do for web2 on shopify."
1379085,"We've got a super diverse group of investors, from the obvious gameFi leaders Animoca being our lead investor, to Defi leaders like Mechanism and NGC, we have VC funds from the traditional world like Palmdrive Capital and Cherubic Ventures and VR powerhouse HTC. We pulled in japanese gaming giant akatsuki as well who has the gaming rights to one piece and dragon balls for us to start doing crossovers with real soon too!"

1379071,Our competitors are generally earlier stages than we are or have built games and worlds with low poly design confined to browsers. To reach for higher heights in the gaming industry we've challenged oursleves to target AAA quality builds on dedicated game engines and push to become future proof with direct native VR and console support.
1379069,"Strength:
- 6 years of experience in the industry 
- Strong brand and celebrity relationships 
- Product Alpha ready to launch within a month 

Weaknesses:
- Emerging tech does not have mainstream following yet
- Facebook/EPIC Games centralized approach to metaverse has more money and labor power 

Opportunity:
- Introducing a brand new market and channel to Brands, augmenting their traditional ecommerce potential
- Crypto as a alternative payment system can create overnight successes in new brands 
- Gaming as a Career expands beyond e-sports with play to earn, democratizing the industry to a growing population of users 

Threats:
- Regulator crackdown on crypto may slow down brand adoption"
1379064,"Can you tell us about market pie you are trying to conquer, your competitors and your SWOT analysis for your offerings?"
1379062,
1379061,looks good
1379060,interesting :D
1379057,"not sure if this will go through but:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tro1LVIDWM&ab_channel=HighstreetMetaverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tro1LVIDWM&ab_channel=HighstreetMetaverse)"
1379055,
1379054,done
1379053,"Solution I'm preparing 
1. We tie real brands of all sorts into our game by interweaving their products directly in the gameplay and lore. This way the time players spent in game actually directly contributes to an existing outside economy, the products they buy are stimulating retail markets directly. Earn in Game, Spend in Game, Gain in real life. I think this creates a balance where value is being created at every segment of the project. 

2. We sell our limited edition collectibles on a bonding curve, meaning at any stage buyers will be able to exit. Every purchase increase the price, every sale decrease the price, if everybody buys the price shoots up, if everybody sells the price goes back to its initial starting point. This way everyone who's bought a product will be able to exit and sell whenever they want to. Since tokens are being used to represent the product, no more logistical burdens fall on collectible traders. Further more real collectors redeem by burning the token and receiving products directly from brands which eliminates the chances of fraud altogether. 

3. The same bonding curve tactic benifit brands too, not only does the market dictate how well you do and what you're product is priced at, but the more hype you have the better you generally will do. This also help merge primary and secondary market together in the traditional sense, where users buy and sell collectibles on the same market place allowing the merchants to capture the price growth all the way through."
1379048,"Why I think these are problems
1. Right now most play to earn games are pure clicking and confines its economics within the game itself, at some point the yield will run out, and prior to that it's a magnet for bot farmers 
2. If I buy something on open-sea chances are it'll become iliquid over time, if I buy limited edition nike drops by lining up through the night, chances are I'll have to find a buyer on stockx, authenticate, be responsible to ship it, and various other logistical nightmares. 
3. If i'm an influencer launching a new brand, chances are I don't have the business expertise to figure out pricing and where my market price is. I build all this hype then risk it going to  waste if my execution is poor. Further if i'm a brand that sells 200 sneakers for 200 dollars each, im making 40k total while scalpers are making 5X on flipping it where I don't see a single dime from secondary markets"
1379042,"Problem we are solving:
There are several problems we're tackling 
1. Sustainable Play To Earn Economy 
2. Liquidity in Collectibles/Alt Asset market
3. Price Discovery and Hype Monetization"
1379041,
1379040,"Can you tell us all more about project, the idea, how it started? and specially why its needed or how is it disrupting? 

We can break to following
the problem you are trying to solve
Why you think thats the problem
Whats the solution you are proposing
How you solve it"

1379018,now we combine MMORPG with the shopify concept where all our in-game items are phygital (both physical and digital)
1379013,In a way the perfect storm gave me the opportunity to launch Highstreet with a brilliant team
1379011,I ran a VR company for the past 6 years and the rise of NFT paired with the pandemic really got our retail customers thinking about digital worlds and on-chain integration
1379010,which lead to the whole inception ofselling products on bonding curves
1379009,Then of course defi2020 i spent a lot of time explorining and investing in AMMs
1379008,"I've been an early investor since 2015, was early into the 2017 ICO realm as well investing into many projects from the neo and qtum ecosystem."

it was a pleasure hosting you :D"
1378885,Yes there is staking involved with Aegis token in the near future. Development is close to finishing.
1378882,"What motivated me to create this whole system is because I've had my fair experience of getting rugged with some projects. Using our insurance system, it promotes investors to have confidence of investing his funds without the worry of him/her getting rugged. We will refund 100% of investments of people who will be able to participate on our IDO platform if the project that launched on us exit scammed or do any malicious intent to scam our investors."
1378877,"Fantastic question. During bear markets, new projects or current solid projects that are solid are not excluded from red candles. Our P2E system will remain profitable during any market condition. You must hold a certain amount of Aegis tokens to play the game."
1378874,An NFT Game viable for fruitful P2E and a launch pad for IDO'S to create more types of projects and P2E projects. As we progress forward we will be developing a more sophisticated and interactive game to attract more and more users like Axie did.
1378873,"Oh I'm happy you mentioned it. We're currently working with @solid_1 (Solid group) regarding the audit. They should be able to release the audit results before we start IDO. Security of our investors is our top priority, and a security audit is very appropriate to the project."

According to Bank of America, 94 million people from developing countries would be ready to buy digital assets more stable than national currencies, devalued by hyperinflation.

And if we consider the percentage of the unbanked population in the world, users could still increase.

In this context, the reserves of BTC in exchanges are at annual lows, causing a supply crunch.

If the digital gold rush really starts in emerging markets, the next few months will be decidedly overheated.

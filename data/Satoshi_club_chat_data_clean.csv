Thank you.","ð¼Hello Demole team. I read that within the Demole platform, we can train our monster, and the best part of that is that our monsters increase their level and receive DML tokens even if we are not online. Will we receive DML tokens every time we train our monsters? What does the amount of DML tokens we receive for each training depend on? Does it depend on the duration of the training? Thank you."

NFT Market Potentials:
**Starting from a small amount of $30 million in 2017 , NFT market capitalization now accounted for over 710 million dollars in 2021. In addition, spending on mobile games grew by more than $1 billion last year.

**Gaming Market Potentials:** 
The size of the entire gaming market is approximately 200 billion dollars, with about half of that in the mobile gaming sector. Following the Datamagic Report in 2021, Mobile and PC revenues are projected to account for 72.8% of the Global game market. 

**Demole's solution: 
**Demole is the perfect bridge between these 2 markets, a game for not only investors who want to earn but also for gamers who are looking for the fantasy game with the breathtaking game plot and 3D graphics. We will bring out the very first 3D NFT Defi monster Legends in the market in Q4, 2021.

1202204,"Here's how asymmetric minting and redeeming works: To mint USDM token, the user must add one of the Mars Treasury whitelisted assets to the Mars Treasury. For example, the user can mint 5 USDM with $5 ETH. However, when the user wants to redeem 5 USDM, XMS token is given to the user instead of ETH. Thus, antisymmetric minting is provided. In addition, assets in the Mars Treasury will support the value of USDM and XMS. Finally, thanks to Support Ratio, USDM's market cap will be limited by XMS's market cap. This will reflect positively on the price of XMS. 

In short, thanks to the anti-minting and redeeming mechanism, the spiral of death is prevented.

When USDM market price > $1:
Arbitrageurs can use $1 worth of the Mars Treasury whitelisted assets (such as BTC) to mint 1 USDM in the Mars Treasury, They can then sell the newly minted USDM in the market to make a profit. This arbitrage action will quickly bring the market price of USDM back to $1.


When  USDM market price < $1: 
Arbitrageurs can buy 1 USDM in the market for less than $1 and then redeem it in the Mars Treasury to obtain $1 worth of XMS. The redeemed XMS can be sold in the market to make a profit. As long as XMS has sufficient liquidity in the market, this arbitrage action will quickly bring the market price of USDM back to $1.","Here's how asymmetric minting and redeeming works: To mint USDM token, the user must add one of the Mars Treasury whitelisted assets to the Mars Treasury.

This ensures that new individuals are not blindly coming in to unregulated products but products vetted by licensed entities.
